                I was born and raised in Crystal Lake, IL. It is a small suburb about an hour north of Chicago. I have loved a lot of the places I have lived so far, but Chicago will always have my heart. Though I don't miss the cold weather, I do miss being so close to Chicago. I have so many memeories growing up and going into the city with my family and friends and taking in all Chicago had to offer.

                From a young age I was in love with dance of all types but especially with ballet. I loved the elegance and grace it portrayed and watching a story come to life with only expressive movements. I loved it so much that I actually went on to study it at Butler University! Though I am now retired from dancing, it still brings me so much joy to watch it (and sometimes do it, but not as well as I used to).

                A fun fact about me, is that I actually met my husband at Butler University. We were both in the dance program and in the same major. Our senior year we were the featured dancers in a new ballet created on us. It was such a wodnerful experience, especially since that was both one of the last times we ever performed on stage. We both retired after college to pursue other interests professionally.
